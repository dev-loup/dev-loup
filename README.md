### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my projects, this is my little codecrafting site. Currently i'm a NodeJS Backend Developer at Globant but i was a holberton student so you may see a lot of related repositories here; as they are my path for being a great software developer ðŸŒ± i'll keep the holberton's code just like the first time i made it.

By now i'm getting my skills polished with platzi and in the free-time i'm studying japanese and play Xbox videogames

I enjoy moving on a lot of things so before coding i studied graphic design for almost three years and after that i got a bachelor in bussiness management.
